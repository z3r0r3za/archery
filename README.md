# Arch Linux Guides

Various guides and scripts for installing and setting up Arch Linux.

1. [Arch Linux Install Guide](archlinux_install_guide.md) - (i3wm basic/default)
2. [Arch Linux Install Script](arch_install.sh) - clone to the installer ISO and run it to install arch/i3wm.
3. [Custom i3wm Config and more](i3_setup.sh) - i3wm and other configs, themes, etc. To be run after arch_install.sh (still in progress, but seems to be working ok).

When booted on an arch linux iso you can run the [arch_install.sh](arch_install.sh) to get a basic default i3wm setup (after installing git). Then if you want to see more i3, you can run the [i3wm_setup.sh](i3_setup.sh) right after that.
